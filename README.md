# Mitigating-DDoS-Attacks

This project discusses and proactively identify and mitigate DDoS attacks in real time by analyzing
network traffic patterns. The goal is to create an adaptive mechanism that evolves with
emerging threats, ensuring optimal network performance and availability. Integration with
existing security infrastructure and scalability considerations are essential for an effective,
responsive, and comprehensive defence against DDoS attacks.
